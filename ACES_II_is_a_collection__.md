ACES II is a collection of programs that designed to perform ab initio quantum chemistry calculations.
It supports many sorts of calculations at different levels of theory. ACES II is especially useful to treat electron correlation. These methods largely are categorized as many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and the coupled-cluster (CC) approximation \cite{Lotrich_2008}.
