Ergo is a quantum chemistry program for large-scale self-consistent field calculations. It performs electronic structure calculations using Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham density functional theory. Ergo also includes both core and valence electrons in the calculations. It uses both restricted and unrestricted models for energy calculations and many more \cite{Rudberg_2011}.
