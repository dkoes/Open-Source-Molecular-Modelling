AZOrange is a machine learning package that supports QSAR model building in a full work flow from descriptor computation to automated model building, validation and selection. It promotes model accuracy by using several high performance machine learning algorithms for efficient data set specific selection of the statistical approach \cite{St_lring_2011}.
