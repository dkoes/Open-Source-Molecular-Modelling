JANPA is a package for Natural Population Analysis - a method for partial atomic charges calculation and Natural Atomic Orbital creation. JANPA can be applied to analyse electronic structures produced by PSI4, NwChem, ORCA, Gaussian, GAMESS and other common quantum chemistry packages \cite{Nikolaienko_2014}.
