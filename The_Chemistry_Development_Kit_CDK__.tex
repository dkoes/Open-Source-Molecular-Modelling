The Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) is a Java library for bio- and cheminformatics and computational chemistry. It is able to read and write chemical data formats, render chemical structures, calculate QSAR descriptors, and has algorithms for chemical graph theory \cite{Steinbeck_2003}\cite{Steinbeck_2006}.
