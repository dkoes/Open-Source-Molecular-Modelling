GPAW is a DFT Python code used based on the projector-augmented wave (PAW) technique \cite{Bl_chl_1994} \cite{Kresse_1999} and the atomic simulation environment (ASE). It utilizes real-space uniform grids and multigrid approaches, atom-centered basis-functions or plane-waves \cite{Mortensen_2005} \cite{Enkovaara_2010}.
