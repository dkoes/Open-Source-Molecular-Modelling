Biological Data Interactive Clustering Explorer (BioDICE) is a Taverna plugin that clusters high-dimensional biological data and provides a nonlinear, topology preserving projection for the visualization of the input data and their similarities. Fast Learning Self Organizing Map (FLSOM) is the core algorithm in the BioDICE plugin which is an enhanced variant of the Self Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm. An interactive 2D map provides the visual exploration of multidimensional data and the identification of groups of similar objects \cite{2010}.
