Strip-itâ„¢ is a program linked against the C++ library of OpenBabel aimed at identifying and extracting predefined scaffolds from organic small molecules. It proposes several molecular scaffolds for extraction. These predefined scaffolds include molecular frameworks as originally described by Bemis and Murcko \cite{Bemis_1996}, molecular frameworks and the reduced molecular frameworks as defined by Ansgar Schuffenhauer and coworkers \cite{Schuffenhauer_2007} and scaffold topologies as described by Sara Pollock and coworkers \cite{Pollock_2008}.
