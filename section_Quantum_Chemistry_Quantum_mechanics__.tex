\section{Quantum Chemistry}
Quantum mechanics (QM) is increasingly accessible and relevant to molecular modeling and \textit{in silico} drug design \cite{Vivo_2011}. Quantum chemistry models molecules at the level of their wave function and offers enhanced accuracy and detail compared to classical models at a substantial increase in computation.
Linear scaling methods apply various simplification to efficiently scale when analyzing larger molecular systems.

QM plays a key role to resolve different problems from scoring proteinâ€“ligand poses to calculate QM descriptors for QSAR model building.  By the extraordinary increase in computational facilities, development and use of sophisticated algorithms for calculating wave functions of macromolecular systems have been accelerated \cite{Merz_2010}. Herein, several open source packages for quantum chemical calculations are explained.
