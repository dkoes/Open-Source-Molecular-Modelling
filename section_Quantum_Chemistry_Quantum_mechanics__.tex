\section{Quantum Chemistry}
Quantum mechanics (QM) is increasingly accessible and relevant to molecular modeling and \textit{in silico} drug design \cite{Vivo_2011}. Quantum chemistry models molecules at the level of their wave function and offers enhanced accuracy and detail compared to classical models at a substantial increase in computation time.  Corresponding to the large diversity of solution methods for Schr\"odinger's equation, there are many software packages for \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry, as well as programs for interpreting and visualizing the results of these calculations.
