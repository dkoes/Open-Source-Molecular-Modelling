chemf  is a purely functional chemistry toolkit written in Scala, a modern multi-paradigm programming language. Using functional programming in chemistry chemf describes an immutable data structure for molecular graphs together with several simple algorithms to compute basic molecular features for writing a complete SMILES parser according to the OpenSMILES specification \cite{H_ck_2012}.
