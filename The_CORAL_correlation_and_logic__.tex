The CORAL (correlation and logic) is a collection of software and databases to build up quantitative structure-property /activity relationship (QSPR /QSAR) models.  Input for CORAL is a data set in form of strings. The QSPR/QSAR models are built based on one-variable correlations between an endpoint and descriptors computed with SMILES.
