Monstergauss is a derivation of initial versions of parts of the Gaussian 80/82 series of programs. It is easily portable to a variety of computer systems, and includes incorporated features not present in the Gaussian program suite. Monstergauss presents features like analytic gradient optimization of geometries, together with various other options such as Restricted Hartree-Fock open shell SCF, pair-wise MC-SCF, Boys localization, one electron properties, quantitative PMO analysis, a direct CI, the Morokuma Energy Decomposition, and a basis set superposition error correction.
