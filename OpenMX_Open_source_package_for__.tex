OpenMX (Open source package for Material eXplorer) is a quantum chemistry package for nano-scale material simulations based on DFT, norm-conserving pseudopotentials, and pseudo-atomic localized basis functions. OpenMX is capable of performing calculations of physical properties such as magnetic, dielectric, and electric transport properties \cite{Parq_2014}.
