\section{Visualization}
  
An essential component of any molecular modeling exercise is the ability to visualize and, sometimes, edit molecular data.  Visualization software usually either deals with exclusively 2D or 3D molecular data and may be primarily intended for desktop usage (native `fat' clients) or as a component embedded in a web browser.
