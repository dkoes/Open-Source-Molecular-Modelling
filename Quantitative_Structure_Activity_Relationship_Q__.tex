(Quantitative) Structure-Activity Relationship ((Q)SAR) approaches were designed to find relationships between chemical structure of a series of compounds (or structural-related properties) and a biological activity \cite{1995}. Molecular descriptors are representative measures of chemical structures that encode structure information and usually arranged in a two-way multivariate data table \cite{Consonni_2009}. Multivariate statistical methods are then applied to make a mathematical relationship between that matrix of molecular features and related biological activity. In cases that the number of molecular descriptors is higher than the number of compounds, variable selection approaches come up to optimally select a subset of molecular descriptors that represent necessary information, decrease noise and remove redundant descriptors not relevant to the activity prediction. Up to now, several open source tools have been proposed with a range of capabilities from calculation of molecular descriptors to QSAR model buildings that are defined as follows.
