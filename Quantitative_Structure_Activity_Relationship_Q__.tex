(Quantitative) Structure-Activity Relationship ((Q)SAR) approaches designed to find relationships between chemical structure of a series of compounds (or structural-related properties) and a biological activity \cite{1995}. Molecular descriptors are representative measures of chemical structures that encode structure information and usually arranged in a two-way multivariate data table \cite{Consonni_2009}. Multivariate statistical methods are then applied to make a mathematical relationship between a matrix of molecular features and a biological activity. In cases that the number of molecular descriptors is higher than the number of compounds, variable selection approaches come up to optimally select a subset of molecular descriptors that represent necessary information, decrease noise and remove redundant descriptors not relevant to the activity prediction. Several open source tools have been proposed with a range of capabilities from calculation of molecular descriptors to QSAR model buildings.
