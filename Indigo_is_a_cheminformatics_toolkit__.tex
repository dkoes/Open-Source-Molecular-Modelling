Indigo is a cheminformatics toolkit and API that contains a number of unique algorithms developed by EPAM, as well as some common standard algorithms in the cheminformatics field. Indigo provides full capabilities for substructure matching of query molecules, including ones loaded from SMARTS expressions. It compromises KNIME nodes, Legio: GUI application for combinatorial chemistry, ChemDiff: Visual comparison of two SDF or SMILES files, indigo-depict: Molecule and reaction rendering utility, indigo-cano: Canonical SMILES generator, and indigo-deco: R-Group deconvolution utility \cite{Pavlov_2011}.
