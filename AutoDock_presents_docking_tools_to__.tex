AutoDock presents docking tools to predict how small molecules bind to a biomolecular target. AutoDock consist of AutoDock 4 and AutoDock Vina. AutoDock can have applications in X-ray crystallography, structure-based drug design, lead optimization, virtual screening, combinatorial library design, protein-protein docking, and chemical mechanism studies.
