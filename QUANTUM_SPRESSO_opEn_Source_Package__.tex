QUANTUM SPRESSO (open-source package for research in electronic structure, simulation, and optimization) included code packages that perform electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale. It works on the basis of density-functional theory, using a Plane-Wave basis set and pseudopotentials.
