AutoClickChem \cite{Durrant_2012} performs \textit{in silico} click chemistry to generate large libraries of synthetically accessible compounds.

AutoGrow \cite{Durrant_2013} uses a genetic algorithm to explore the space of reactants and reactions accessible view AutoClickChem and identify compounds that dock well using AutoDock Vina.

igrow, like AutoGrow, uses a genetic algorithm but transforms ligands using branch exchange and uses idock as the underlying docking evaluation protocol.

OpenGrowth  \cite{Ch_ron_2015}  assembles candidate ligands by connecting small organic fragments in the active site of proteins.  It includes a graphical user interface.
