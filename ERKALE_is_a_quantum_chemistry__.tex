ERKALE is a quantum chemistry code capable of solving the electronic structure of atoms, molecules and molecular clusters. ERKALE was designed to compute the x-ray properties, such as ground-state electron momentum densities and Compton profiles, and core (x-ray absorption and x-ray Raman scattering) and valence electron excitation spectra of atoms and molecules \cite{Lehtola_2012}.
