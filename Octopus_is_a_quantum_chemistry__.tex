Octopus is a quantum chemistry program aimed at the ab initio virtual experimentation on a number of system types. DFT is used to treat electrons, in its time-dependent form (TDDFT) when doing simulations in time while nuclei are described classically as point particles. Pseudopotential approximation is used to describe electron-nucleus interaction \cite{Castro_2006}.
