ACPC (AutoCorrelation of Partial Charges) \cite{Berenger_2014} computes ligand similarity based on a rotation and translation invariant electrostatic descriptor.

Align-it\textsuperscript{TM} is a successor of Pharao \cite{Taminau_2008} and aligns and scores 3D representations of molecules based on their pharmacophore features.  It includes a plugin for integration with PyMOL.

Molpher  \cite{Hoksza_2014} generates a virtual chemical library that represents the chemical space between two input molecules as it consists of the path found by morphing one molecule to another.


Shape-it\textsuperscript{TM} uses Gaussian volumes to align and score molecular shapes.
