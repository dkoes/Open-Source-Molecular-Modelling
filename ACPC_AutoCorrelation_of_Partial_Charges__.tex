ACPC (AutoCorrelation of Partial Charges) \cite{Berenger_2014} computes ligand similarity based on a rotation and translation invariant electrostatic descriptor.

Align-it\textsuperscript{TM} is a successor of Pharao \cite{Taminau_2008} and aligns and scores 3D representations of molecules based on their pharmacophore features.  It includes a plugin for integration with PyMOL.

Open3DALIGN \cite{Tosco_2011} performs unsupervised rigid-body molecular alignment.

PAPER \cite{Haque_2010} performs GPU accelerated alignment of molecular shapes using Gaussian overlays.

Shape-it\textsuperscript{TM} uses Gaussian volumes to align and score molecular shapes.
