Gromacs \cite{Pronk_2013} is a complete and well-established package for molecular dynamics simulations that provides high performance on both CPUs and GPUs.  It can be used for free energy and QM/MM calculations.

MEPSA (Minimum Energy Pathway Analysis) \cite{Marcos_Alcalde_2015} provides tools for analyzing energy landscapes and pathways.

OpenMM  \cite{Eastman_2013} is a substantial toolkit for high performance molecular dynamics simulations that includes support for GPU acceleration.
