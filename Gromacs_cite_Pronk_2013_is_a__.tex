Gromacs \cite{Pronk_2013} is a complete and well-established package for molecular dynamics simulations that provides high performance on both CPUs and GPUs.  It can be used for free energy and QM/MM calculations.

LAMMPS  \cite{Plimpton_1995} 

MDynaMix \cite{Lyubartsev_2000} 


MEPSA (Minimum Energy Pathway Analysis) \cite{Marcos_Alcalde_2015} provides tools for analyzing energy landscapes and pathways.

OpenMM  \cite{Eastman_2013} is a substantial toolkit for high performance molecular dynamics simulations that includes support for GPU acceleration.

PLUMED \cite{Tribello_2014} interfaces with an assortment of molecular dynamics software packages to provide a unified interface for performing free energy calculations using methods such as metadynamics, umbrella sampling and steered MD (Jarzynski). 

yank is built off of OpenMM and provides Python interface for performing alchemical free energy calculations.
