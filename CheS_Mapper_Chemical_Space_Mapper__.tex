CheS-Mapper (Chemical Space Mapper) is a 3D-viewer for small compounds in chemical datasets. It embeds a dataset into 3D space in such a way that the relationship between the structure of chemical compounds, their physico-chemical properties, and biological or toxic effects can be analyzed. In chemical space, compounds that have similar descriptor values places close to each other. CheS-Mapper can calculate variety of descriptors and supports clustering and 3D alignment \cite{G_tlein_2012}\cite{G_tlein_2014}.
