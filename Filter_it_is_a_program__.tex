Filter-itâ„¢ is a program for calculation of molecular properties and filtering out molecules based on input filter definition criteria. The properties comprise, amongst others: physicochemical parameters, Graph-based properties, including ring-based parameters and rotatable bond criteria. Selection criteria can be by means of smarts patterns, similarity criteria; and three-dimensional distances between user-definable fragments.
