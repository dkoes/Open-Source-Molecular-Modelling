Psi4 is a suite of ab initio quantum chemistry programs designed for simulations of a variety of molecular properties. It supports a wide range of computations (e.g., Hartreeâ€“Fock, MP2, coupled-cluster) and general procedures such as geometry optimization and vibrational frequency analysis with more than 2500 basis functions running serially or in parallel \cite{Turney_2011}.
