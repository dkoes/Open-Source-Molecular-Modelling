Open Babel is C++ chemical toolbox useful to search, convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling, chemistry, solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related fields. It includes ready-to-use programs, and complete programmer's toolkit. Open Babel inputs, writes and converts over 110 chemical file formats, and filters and searches molecular files using SMARTS and other methods. It was used in many cheminformatics and bioinformatics tool developments \cite{O_Boyle_2011}.
