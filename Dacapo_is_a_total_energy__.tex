Dacapo is a total energy program within density functional theory. A plane wave basis is used for the valence electronic states and describing the core-electron interactions with Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudo-potentials. It performs self-consistent calculations for both Local Density Approximation (LDA) and various Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) exchange-correlations potentials. The program is capable of doing molecular dynamics/structural relaxation simultaneous with solving the Schrodinger equations based on density functional theory.
