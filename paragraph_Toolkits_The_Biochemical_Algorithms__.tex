\paragraph{Toolkits}
The Biochemical Algorithms Library (BALL) \cite{Hildebrandt_2010} provides an object-oriented C++ library for structural bioinformatics, and its capabilities include molecular mechanics, support for reading and writing a variety of file formats, protein-ligand scoring, docking, and QSAR modeling.

The Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) \cite{Steinbeck_2006} is a cheminformatics toolkit written in Java.  Its capabilities include support for reading and writing a variety of chemical formats, descriptor and fingerprint calculation, force field calculations, substructure search, and structure generation.

Chem$^f$ \cite{H_ck_2012} is a minimal cheminformatics toolkit written in the functional language Scala.

ChemmineR \cite{Cao_2008}  is a cheminformatics package for the R statistical programming languages that is built using OpenBabel. Its capabilities include property calculations, similarity search, and classification and clusters of compounds.

ConvertMAS is a utility for converting between formates and merging and splitting multi-molecule files.

CurlySMILES \cite{Drefahl_2011} provides parsing functionality for an extension of the SMILES format that supports the description of complex molecular systems.

\paragraph{Graphical Development Environments}

Ambit \cite{Jeliazkova_2011} integrates with CDK to provide web-based applications for chemical search and analysis.

Bioclipse  \cite{Spjuth_2009} is a workbench, based on the Eclipse framework, for manipulating and analyzing biochemical data and databases. It integrates with CDK and Jmol to provide cheminformatic functionality and also has modules for bioinformatics (primarly sequence analysis) and QSAR modeling.

Galaxy \cite{Goecks_2010} is a web platform for exploring biomedical data and includes as a component a Chemical Toolbox that integrates a number of other cheminformatics tools to offer an array of molecular search, property calculation, clustering, and manipulations capabilities.


\paragraph{Molecular Editors}

BKChem is a 2D molecular editor written in python that uses the Tk GUI toolkit.

Chemtool is a 2D molecular editor for LInux systems that uses the GTK toolkit.
