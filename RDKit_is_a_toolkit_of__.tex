RDKit is a toolkit of cheminformatics and machine-learning codes written in C++ and Python. It can operate 2D and 3D molecular structures. RDKit calculates descriptors and fingerprints for machine learning purposes and provides a platform for substructure and similarity searches. It also provides cheminformatics nodes for KNIME. RDKit worked efficiently for cheminformatics and bioinformatics tool development purposes.
