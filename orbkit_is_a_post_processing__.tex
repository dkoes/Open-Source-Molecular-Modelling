orbkit is a post-processing Python package that reads wavefunction data extracted from output files of MOLPRO (Molden File Format), TURBOMOLE (AOMix file format), GAMESS-US, and Gaussian (.log File and Formatted Checkpoint File). It has several computational capabilities including atomic orbitals, molecular orbitals, electron density, and the spatial derivatives of these quantities, reduced electron density, electron density for selected molecular orbitals, mulliken and LÃ¶wdin population analysis, analytical overlap integrals between atomic and molecular orbitals, atom-projected electron density and molecular orbital transition electronic flux density.
