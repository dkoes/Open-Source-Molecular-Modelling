\paragraph{Docking}

ADplugin is a plugin for PyMOL for interfacing with AutoDock and AutoDock Vina.

AutoDock \cite{Morris_2009} is an automated docking program that uses a physics-based semiempirical scoring function \cite{Huey_2007} mapped to atom type grids to evaluate poses and a genetic algorithm to explore the conformational space.  It includes the ability to incorporate sidechain flexibility and covalent docking.

AutoDock Vina \cite{Trott_2009} is an entirely separate code base and approach from Autodock that was developed with a focus runtime performance and ease of system setup. It uses a fully empirical scoring function and an iterated local search global optimizer to produce docked poses. It includes support for multi-threading and flexible sidechains.

CADDP (computer-aided drug design platform) \cite{Lill_2010} is a collection of plugins for PyMol for controlling and visualizing system setup (AMBER and Reduce) and docking (AutoDock Vina).

DockoMatic \cite{Bullock_2013}  provides a graphical user interface for setting up and analyzing AutoDock and AutoDock Vina docking jobs, including when run on a cluster. It also includes the ability to run inverse virtual screens (find proteins that bind a given ligand) and support for homology model construction.

idock \cite{Li_2012} is a multi-threaded docking program that includes support for the AutoDock Vina scoring function and a random forest scoring function. I can output per-atom free energy information for hotspot detection.

MOLA \cite{Abreu_2010} is a pre-packaged distribution of AutoDock and AutoDock Vina for deployment on multi-platform computing clusters.

Paradocks \cite{Meier_2010} is a parallelized docking program that includes a number of population-based metaheuristics, such as particle swarm optimization, for exploring the 
PyRx \cite{Dallakyan_2014} is a visual interface for AutoDock and AutoDock Vina that simplifies setting up and analyzing docking workflows.  Its future as an open-source solution is in doubt due to a recent shift to commercialization.

rDock \cite{Ruiz_Carmona_2014}  is designed for docking against proteins or nucleic acids and can incorporate user-specified constraints. It uses an empirical scoring function that includes solvent accessible surface area terms. A combination of genetic algorithms, Monte Carlo, and simplex minimization is used to explore the conformational space. Distinct scoring functions are provided for docking to proteins and nucleic acids.

RF-Score \cite{Li_2015,Ballester_2010} uses a random forest classifier to score protein-ligand poses.

smina \cite{Koes_2013} is a fork of AutoDock Vina designed to better support energy minimization and custom scoring function development (scoring function terms and atom type properties can be specified using a run-time configuration file). It also simplifies the process of setting up a docking run with flexible sidechains.

VinaLC  \cite{Zhang_2013} is a fork of AutoDock Vina designed to run on a cluster of multiprocessor machines.

VinaMPI \cite{Ellingson_2013} is a wrapper for AutoDock Vina that uses OpenMPI to run large-scale virtual screens on a computing cluster.

\paragraph{Pocket Detection}

fpocket  \cite{Schmidtke_2011} detects and delineates protein cavities using Voronoi tessellation and is able to process molecular dynamics simulations.

KVFinder \cite{Oliveira_2014} is a PyMOL plugin for identifying and characterizing pockets.

PAPCA (PocketAnalyzerPCA) is a pocket detection utility designed to analyze ensembles of protein conformations.

PCS (Pocket Cavity Search) measures the volume of internal cavities and evaluates the environment of ionizable residues.

POVME (POcket Volume MEasurer) \cite{Durrant_2014} is tool for measuring and characterizing pocket volumes that includes a graphical user interface.
