Siam Quantum (SQ) is a C written quantum chemistry program that using quantum mechanics determines the total energy and wave function of molecules within Hartee-Fock and MP2 method. Some of its features are geometry optimization and simple population analysis, calculate Hartree-Fock and restricted MP2 energies of molecules, perform post SCF calculations such as electron density or molecular orbitals.
