QSAR-tools provides Python scripts for assisting in modeling quantitative structure activity relationships from 2D chemical data. It inputs SMILES file of a training set and computes a set of smarts descriptors unique to that set. By using a fingerprint file, it trains a linear model to predict a numerical quantity of interest and is capable of mapping the model onto the compound to produce an image.
