ChemmineR is an R package able to analyze drug-like small molecule data. With a wide spectrum of algorithms it can process large numbers of small molecules, do physicochemical/structural property predictions, structural similarity searching, and classification and clustering of compound libraries. It also, supplies visualization tools for results of compound clustering and chemical structures \cite{Cao_2008}.
