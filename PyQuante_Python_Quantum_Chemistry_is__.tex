PyQuante (Python Quantum Chemistry) is a suit of programs providing scientists a set of tools that construct their own quantum chemistry programs. It will hopefully provide a working quantum chemistry program as well. Its features include CI-Singles excited states, optimized-effective potential DFT, MINDO/3 semi empirical energies and forces and so on.
