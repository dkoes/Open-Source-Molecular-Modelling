\paragraph{\textit{Ab initio} Calcuation}

ABINIT \cite{Gonze_2009} is a quantum package which is able to calculate the total energy, charge density and electronic structure of molecules and periodic solids within density functional theory (DFT) and Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT), using pseudopotentials and a planewave or wavelet basis. ABINIT also can optimize the geometry, perform molecular dynamics simulations, or generate dynamical matrices, Born effective charges, and dielectric tensors and many more properties. 

ACES \cite{Lotrich_2008} is a collection of programs that perform \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry calculations such as single point energy calculations, analytical gradients, and analytical Hessians, and is highly parallelized, including support for GPU computing.
A focus of ACES is the use of MBPT and the coupled-cluster approximation to reliable treat electron correlation.

BigDFT \cite{Genovese_2008,Mohr_2014,Mohr_2015} 1performs \textit{ab initio} calculations using Daubechies wavelets and has the capability to use a linear scaling method.  Periodic systems, surfaces and isolated systems can be simulated with the proper boundary conditions. It is included as part of ABINIT.

CP2K \cite{Hutter_2013} performs simulations of solid state, liquid, molecular and biological systems. Its particular focus is massively parallel and linear scaling electronic structure methods and state-of-the-art \textit{ab-initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. It is optimized for the mixed Gaussian and Plane-Waves method using pseudopotentials and can run on parallel and on GPUs.

Dacapo is a total energy program that uses density functional theory. It can do molecular dynamics/structural relaxation while solving the Schrodinger equations. It has support for parallel execution and is used through the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) \cite{Bahn_2002}

ErgoSCM \cite{Rudberg_2011} is a quantum chemistry program for large-scale self-consistent field calculations. It performs electronic structure calculations using Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham density functional theory and achieves linear scaling for both CPU usage and memory utilization.

ERKALE \cite{Lehtola_2012} is designed to compute X-ray properties, such as ground-state electron momentum densities and Compton profiles, and core (x-ray absorption and x-ray Raman scattering) and valence electron excitation spectra of atoms and molecules.

GPAW \cite{gpaw} is a DFT code that uses the projector-augmented wave (PAW) technique \cite{Bl_chl_1994,Kresse_1999} and integrates with the  atomic simulation environment (ASE)  \cite{Bahn_2002}. 

Helpful Open-source Research TOol for N-fermion systems (HORTON) has as a primary design goal ease of extensibility for researching new methods in \textit{ab initio} electronic structure theory.

JANPA \cite{Nikolaienko_2014} computes natural atomic orbitals from a reduced one-particle density matrix.

MPQC (massively parallel quantum chemistry program) \cite{Janssen95} offers many features including closed shell, unrestricted and general restricted open shell Hartree-Fock energies and gradients, closed shell, unrestricted and general restricted open shell density functional theory energies and gradients, second order open shell perturbation theory and Z-averaged perturbation theory energies.

Octopus pervorms \textit{ab initio} calculations using time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) and pseudopotentials.  Included in the project is libxc \cite{Marques_2012} which is a standalone library of exchange-correlation functionals for DFT (released under the LGPL).

OpenMX (Open source package for material eXplorer) \cite{Ozaki_2005} is designed for nano-scale material simulations based on DFT, norm-conserving pseudopotentials, and pseudo-atomic localized basis functions. OpenMX is capable of performing calculations of physical properties such as magnetic, dielectric, and electric transport properties and is optimized for large-scale parallelism.

Psi4 \cite{Turney_2011} is a suite of \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry programs that supports a wide range of computations (e.g., Hartreeâ€“Fock, MP2, coupled-cluster) and general procedures such as geometry optimization and vibrational frequency analysis with more than 2500 basis functions running serially or in parallel.


\paragraph{Helper Applications}
FragIt \cite{Steinmann_2012} generates fragments of large molecules to use as input files in quantum chemistry programs that support fragment based methods.

cclib \cite{O_boyle_2008} provides a consistent interface for parsing and interpreting the results of a number of quantum chemistry packages. 

GaussSum \cite{O_boyle_2008} uses cclib to extract useful information from the results of quantum chemistry programs (ADF, GAMESS, Gaussian, Jaguar) including monitoring the progress of geometry optimization, the UV/IR/Raman spectra, molecular orbital (MO) levels and MO contributions.

Geac (Gaussian ESI Automated Creator) extracts data from Gaussian log files. 
Nancy\_EX \cite{Etienne_2014} post-processes Gaussian output and analyzes excited states including natural transition orbitals, detachment and attachment density matrices, and charge-transfer descriptors.

orbkit \cite{hermann2016orbkit} is a post-processing tool for the results of quantum chemistry programs.  It has native support for a number of programs (MOLPRO, TURBOMOLE, GAMESS-US, PROAIMS/AIMPAC, Gaussian) and additionally interfaces with cclib for additional file format support.  It can extract grid-based quantities such as molecular orbitals and electron density, as well as Muliken population charges and other properties.
