\paragraph{\textit{Ab initio} Calcuation}

ABINIT \cite{Gonze_2009} is a quantum package which is able to calculate the total energy, charge density and electronic structure of molecules and periodic solids within density functional theory (DFT) and Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT), using pseudopotentials and a planewave or wavelet basis. ABINIT also can optimize the geometry, perform molecular dynamics simulations, or generate dynamical matrices, Born effective charges, and dielectric tensors and many more properties. 

ACES \cite{Lotrich_2008} is a collection of programs that perform \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry calculations such as single point energy calculations, analytical gradients, and analytical Hessians, and is highly parallelized, including support for GPU computing.
A focus of ACES is the use of MBPT and the coupled-cluster approximation to reliable treat electron correlation.

BigDFT \cite{Genovese_2008,Mohr_2014,Mohr_2015} 1performs \textit{ab initio} calculations using Daubechies wavelets and has the capability to use a linear scaling method.  Periodic systems, surfaces and isolated systems can be simulated with the proper boundary conditions. It is included as part of ABINIT.

CP2K \cite{Hutter_2013} performs simulations of solid state, liquid, molecular and biological systems. Its particular focus is massively parallel and linear scaling electronic structure methods and state-of-the-art \textit{ab-initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. It is optimized for the mixed Gaussian and Plane-Waves method using pseudopotentials and can run on parallel and on GPUs.

Dacapo is a total energy program that uses density functional theory. It can do molecular dynamics/structural relaxation while solving the Schrodinger equations. It has support for parallel execution and is used through the Atomic SImulation Environment (ASE) \cite{Bahn_2002}

ErgoSCM \cite{Rudberg_2011} is a quantum chemistry program for large-scale self-consistent field calculations. It performs electronic structure calculations using Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham density functional theory and achieves linear scaling for both CPU usage and memory utilization.

ERKALE \cite{Lehtola_2012} is designed to compute X-ray properties, such as ground-state electron momentum densities and Compton profiles, and core (x-ray absorption and x-ray Raman scattering) and valence electron excitation spectra of atoms and molecules. 

\paragraph{Helper Applications}
FragIt \cite{Steinmann_2012} generates fragments of large molecules to use as input files in quantum chemistry programs that support fragment based methods.

cclib \cite{O_boyle_2008} provides a consistent interface for parsing and interpreting the results of a number of quantum chemistry packages. 

\paragraph{Visualization}
CCP1GUI provides a graphical user interface to various computational chemistry codes with an emphasis on integration with the GAMESS-UK quantum chemistry program.

ccwatcher provides a graphical interface for the monitoring of computational chemistry programs.
