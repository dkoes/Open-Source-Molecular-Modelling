\paragraph{\textit{Ab initio} Calcuation}

ABINIT \cite{Gonze_2009} is a quantum package which is able to calculate the total energy, charge density and electronic structure of molecules and periodic solids within density functional theory (DFT) and Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT), using pseudopotentials and a planewave or wavelet basis. ABINIT also can optimize the geometry, perform molecular dynamics simulations, or generate dynamical matrices, Born effective charges, and dielectric tensors and many more properties. 

ACES \cite{Lotrich_2008} is a collection of programs that perform \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry calculations such as single point energy calculations, analytical gradients, and analytical Hessians, and is highly parallelized, including support for GPU computing.
A focus of ACES is the use of MBPT and the coupled-cluster approximation to reliable treat electron correlation.

BigDFT \cite{Genovese_2008,Mohr_2014,Mohr_2015} 1performs \textit{ab initio} calculations using Daubechies wavelets and has the capability to use a linear scaling method.  Periodic systems, surfaces and isolated systems can be simulated with the proper boundary conditions. It is included as part of ABINIT.
