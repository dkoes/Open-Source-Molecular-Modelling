HostDesigner is a de novo molecular design software that constructs 3D molecular structures by covalently connecting fragments defined by user with pre-generated hydrocarbon fragments from a library. Desired geometric constraints defined by the user are used to rank the results. It builds and evaluates millions of compounds in minutes.
