ABINIT is a quantum package which is able to calculate the total energy, charge density and electronic structure of molecules and periodic solids within density functional theory (DFT), using pseudopotentials and a planewave or wavelet basis. ABINIT also can optimize the geometry, perform molecular dynamics simulations, or generate dynamical matrices, Born effective charges, and dielectric tensors and many more properties.
