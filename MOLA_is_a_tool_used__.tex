MOLA is a tool used for virtual screening using AutoDock4/Vina for non-experienced users, with no access to dedicated Linux computer clusters. MOLA runs on a customized Live CD GNU/Linux operating system with the ability to bypass the original operating system available on the computers included in the cluster. MOLA is able to automate steps of ligand preparation, parallel AutoDock4/Vina jobs distribution and result analysis \cite{Abreu_2010}.
