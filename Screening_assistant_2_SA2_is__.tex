Screening assistant 2 (SA2) is a Java software that can be used to perform chemoinformatics analysis around chemical libraries. Among chemoinformatics methods that SA2 applies are providers management, interactive visualisation, scaffold analysis, diverse subset creation, descriptors calculation, sub-structure / SMART search, similarity search and filtering. The software is also able to generate diverse libraries based on existing ones \cite{Guilloux_2012}.
