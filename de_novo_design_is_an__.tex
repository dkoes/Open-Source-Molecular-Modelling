de novo design is an approach applied for designing novel, non-peptide, small-molecule compounds for macromolecular binding sites \cite{Schneider_2005}. The designed ligand would complement 3-dimensional binding site properties of the target protein. This method needs a 3D structure of the active site of the macromolecular target plus a defined ligand `anchor point'. A novo design program addresses issues like the way it assembles the candidate compounds, evaluates their quality and samples the search space effectively \cite{Kawai_2014}. A number of open source tools are available to carry out de novo designs that are addressed in this section.
