BALL (Biochemical Algorithms Library) is an application framework written in C++ that has been specifically designed for rapid software prototyping which can significantly decrease development times in the field of computational molecular biology and molecular modeling. It offers an broad set of data structures as well as classes for molecular mechanics, advanced solvation methods, comparison and analysis of protein structures, file import/export, and visualization.
