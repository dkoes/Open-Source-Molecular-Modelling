FragVLIB is a C++ program that performs a pocket similarity search among available ligand-receptor complexes and extracts useful fragments that can be used for fragment-based lead discovery. It finds matches based on 3D-geometric and chemical similarity of the atoms forming the binding pocket. The ligand's fragment(s) related to that binding pocket are then extracted to make a virtual library of fragments (FragVLib) that can be used for structure-based drug design .
