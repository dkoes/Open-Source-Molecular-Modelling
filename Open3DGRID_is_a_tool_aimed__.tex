Open3DGRID is a tool aimed at high-throughput generation of molecular interaction fields (MIFs). It can compute steric potential, electron density and MM/QM electrostatic potential fields. In addition, GRIDKONT binary files produced by GRID, CoMFA/CoMSIA fields, and MOE grid interaction fields can be imported into the program.
