Shape-itâ„¢ is a tool that aligns one or more molecules (with three-dimensional coordinates) onto a reference molecule using the shape of the molecules as the align criterion. Gaussian volumes are used as descriptor for molecular shape. The output of program is all aligned molecules alongside their respective shape overlap scores.
