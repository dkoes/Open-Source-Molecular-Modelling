    LigBuilder v2.0 is a structure-based de novo drug design and optimization program. Ligand molecules within the binding pocket are built based on the three-dimensional structure of the target protein and subsequently screened. Main properties of LigBuilder v2.0 include: detect and analyze the ligand-binding site of the target protein with Cavity, explore design, optimize lead, link fragment, mimic design, estimate binding-affinity, filter ligand, recommend ligand, analyze synthesis, substructure search,  and cluster molecule with Build, Fragment Database, Forbidden Database, Toxicity Database, and Synthesis Database \cite{Wang_2000}\cite{Yuan_2011}.
