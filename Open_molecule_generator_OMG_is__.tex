Open molecule generator (OMG), is a tool for generation of chemical structures using the canonical path augmentation approach, originally designed for simple graph enumeration adding vertices. it can make molecules by adding bonds, handle multigraphs, and accept one or multiple non overlapping prescribed substructures \cite{Peironcely_2012}.
