The open drug discovery toolkit (ODDT) is a Python library with applications in fields of cheminformatics, molecular modeling etc and for both computer aided drug discovery (CADD) developers and researchers. Many methods, such as machine learning scoring functions (RF-Score and NNScore) and wraps other external software were reimplemented in ODDT\cite{W_jcikowski_2015}.
