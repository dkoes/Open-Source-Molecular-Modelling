Topological maximum cross correlation descriptors (TMACC) are interpretable features for the derivation of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). It is based on autocorrelation method. TMACC without using hashing  neither calculate three-dimensional conformations nor do an alignment of structures \cite{Melville_2007}.
