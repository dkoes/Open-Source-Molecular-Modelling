Topological maximum cross correlation descriptors (TMACC) are interpretable features for the derivation of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) based on autocorrelation method. TMACC works without using hashing neither calculates three-dimensional conformations nor does an alignment of structures \cite{Melville_2007}.
