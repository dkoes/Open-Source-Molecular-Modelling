Open3DALIGN is a command-line tool aimed at unsupervised rigid-body molecular alignment. Three methods for alignment are available: atom-based mode, pharmacophore-based mode (using Pharao as the alignment engine), and a mixed fashion using the combination of the latter two methods. Alignments can be performed in a single and multi-conformation way on one or more templates \cite{Tosco_2011}.
