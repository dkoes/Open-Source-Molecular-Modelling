Open3DALIGN  \cite{Tosco_2011}, Open3DGrid, and Open3DQSAR \cite{Tosco_2010} are a suite of related tools that aid in developed 3D QSAR models.  Open3DALIGN performs unsupervised rigid-body molecular alignment, Open3DGrid generates molecular interaction fields (MIFs) in a variety of formats, and Open3DQSAR builds predictive models from the MIFs of aligned molecules.  Calculations can be visualized in real time in PyMOL.
