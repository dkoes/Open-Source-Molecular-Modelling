VIDEAN (visual and interactive descriptor analysis) is a tool for choosing a subset of descriptors from a group of candidate subsets for predicting a target property with aid of statistical methods with interactive visualizations. The available statistical methods are linear regressions, decision trees and neural networks, from WEKA libraries \cite{Mart_nez_2015}.
