AutoDock 4 is a tool from AutoDock suite of docking tools. It describes the target protein as a set of grids pre-calculated by autogrid and uses autodock to perform docking of the ligand against these grids. AutoDock 4 can guide medicinal chemists to design better ligands by visualization of the atomic affinity grids.
