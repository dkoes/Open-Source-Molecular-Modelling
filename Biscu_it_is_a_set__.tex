Biscu-it™ is a set of Python functions and C++ libraries that are built based on the RDKit chemoinformatics toolkit. The QED (quantitative estimation of drug-likeness) was generated by the RDKit-based implementation of Biscu-it™. The empirical rationale of the QED measure reflects the underlying distribution of molecular properties including molecular weight, topological polar surface area, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, logP, the number of aromatic rings and rotatable bonds, and the presence of unwanted chemical functionalities.
