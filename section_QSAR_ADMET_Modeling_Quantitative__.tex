\section{QSAR/ADMET Modeling}
  
Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship QSAR approaches were designed to find relationships between chemical structure of a series of compounds (or structural-related properties) and a biological activity \cite{1995}, including ADMET properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity). Molecular descriptors are representative measures of chemical structures that encode structure information and are usually arranged in a two-way multivariate data table \cite{Consonni_2009}. Multivariate statistical methods are then applied to make a mathematical relationship between that matrix of molecular features and related biological activity. In cases where the number of molecular descriptors is higher than the number of compounds, variable selection approaches may be applied to select a subset of molecular descriptors in order to decrease noise and remove redundant descriptors not relevant to the activity prediction. Several open source tools have been proposed with a range of capabilities from calculation of molecular descriptors to QSAR model building.
