cApp is a Java software that enables the user to make a comparision between chemical descriptors and similarities of compounds. It includes the tasks of compound appraisal, similarity search and clustering of molecules. The compound appraisal task calculates physico-chemical properties and structural features, investigation of various likeness criteria (drug-, lead- or fragment-like) and the detection of PAINs SMARTS filter components with the SMSD maximum common subgraph (MCS) Tanimoto coefficient as criterion \cite{Amani_2015}.
