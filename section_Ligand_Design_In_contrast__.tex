\section{Ligand Design} 

In contrast to virtual screening, which evaluates predetermined compounds, \textit{de novo} ligand design attempt to create a molecule `from scratch' that binds to a protein.  Methods differ in how the specific the objective to optimize (e.g., docking score to a protein) and how candidate molecules are created.  A key challenge is maintaining synthetic accessibility in the proposed molecules.
