cclib is a library of Python scripts, aimed at parsing and interpreting the results of computational chemistry packages. cclib extracts (parse) data from the output files generated by several programs. It provides a consistent interface to the results of computational chemistry calculations, particularly the results that are applied for algorithms or visualization. Algorithms that are not specific to a particular computational chemistry package can be implemented using with cclib \cite{O_boyle_2008}.
