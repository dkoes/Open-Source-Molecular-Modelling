\paragraph{Toolkits}

The Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) \cite{Steinbeck_2006} is a cheminformatics toolkit written in Java.  Its capabilities include support for reading and writing a variety of chemical formats, descriptor and fingerprint calculation, force field calculations, substructure search, and structure generation.

\paragraph{Graphical Development Environments}

Ambit \cite{Jeliazkova_2011} integrates with CDK to provide web-based applications for chemical search and analysis.

Bioclipse is a workbench, based on the Eclipse framework, for manipulating and analyzing biochemical data and databases. It integrates with CDK and Jmol to provide cheminformatic functionality and also has modules for bioinformatics (primarly sequence analysis) and QSAR modeling.
